# Vision

Vision is an Android Application developed in Kotlin using Android Studio. It allows users to create and manage tasks that need to be completed. Users can add tasks by providing a title, description, and completion date and time. Once the task is completed the user can then Delete the Task or even Edit the Task. The app utilizes Fragments and a RecyclerView to display the list of Tasks. It offers sorting options to arrange the tasks in ascending or descending order based on alphabetical order or the earliest to the latest completion date. The app also includes a login page for user onboarding and logout functionality. Additionally, it features a profile page created with Jetpack Compose, displaying user details such as name and contact number, which were entered on the login page and stored in Shared Preferences. The app fetches the user's location using the static method getFusedLocationProviderClient from the LocationServices class.
